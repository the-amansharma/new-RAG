No. Nature of Supply General Description of Supply\n(1) (2) (3)\n1 Integrated discovery and This process involves discovery and\ndevelopment development of molecules by\n2 Integrated development pharmaceutical sector for medicinal use. The\nsteps include designing of compound,\nevaluation of the drug metabolism,\n1\n\n[PAGE 2]\nbiological activity, manufacture of target\ncompounds, stability study and long-term\ntoxicology impact.\n3 Evaluation of the efficacy of new This is in vivo research (i.e. within the\nchemical/ biological entities in animal) and involves development of\nanimal models of disease customized animal model diseases and\nadministration of novel chemical in doses to\nanimals to evaluate the gene and protein\nexpression in response to disease. In\nnutshell, this process tries to discover if a\nnovel chemical entity that can reduce or\nmodify the severity of diseases. The novel\nchemical is supplied by the service recipient\nlocated in non-taxable territory.\n4 Evaluation of biological activity of This is in vitro research (i.e. outside the\nnovel chemical/ biological entities animal). An assay is first developed and then\nin in-vitro assays the novel chemical is supplied by the service\nrecipient located in non-taxable territory and\nis evaluated in the assay under optimized\nconditions.\n5 Drug metabolism and This process involves investigation whether\npharmacokinetics of new chemical a new compound synthesized by supplier\nentities can be developed as new drug to treat\nhuman diseases in respect of solubility,\nstability in body fluids, stability in liver\ntissue and its toxic effect on body tissues.\nPromising compounds are further evaluated\nin animal experiments using rat and mice.\n6 Safety Assessment/ Toxicology Safety assessment involves evaluation of\nnew chemical entities in laboratory research\nanimal models to support filing of\ninvestigational new drug and new drug\napplication. Toxicology team analyses the\npotential toxicity of a drug to enable fast and\neffective drug development.\n7 Stability Studies Stability studies are conducted to support\nformulation, development, safety and\nefficacy of a new drug. It is also done to\nascertain the quality and shelf life of the\ndrug in their intended packaging\nconfiguration.\n8 Bio-equivalence and Bio- Bio-equivalence is a term in\navailability Studies pharmacokinetics used to assess the\nexpected in vivo biological equivalence of\ntwo proprietary preparations of a drug. If\n2\n\n[PAGE 3]\ntwo products are said to be bioequivalent it\nmeans that they would be expected to be, for\nall intents and purposes, the same. Bio-\navailability is a measurement of the rate and\nextent to which a therapeutically active\nchemical is absorbed from a drug product\ninto the systemic circulation and becomes\navailable at the site of action.\n9 Clinical trials The drugs that are developed for human\nconsumption would undergo human testing\nto confirm its utility and safety before being\nregistered for marketing. The clinical trials\nhelp in collection of information related to\ndrugs profile in human body such as\nabsorption, distribution, metabolism,\nexcretion and interaction. It allows choice of\nsafe dosage.\n10 Bio analytical studies Bio analysis is a sub-discipline of analytical\nchemistry covering the quantitative\nmeasurement of drugs and their metabolites,\nand biological molecules in unnatural\nlocations or concentrations and\nmacromolecules, proteins, DNA, large\nmolecule drugs and metabolites in biological\nsystems.\n2.
