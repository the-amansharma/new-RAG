In\nnutshell, this process tries to discover if a\nnovel chemical entity that can reduce or\nmodify the severity of diseases. The novel\nchemical is supplied by the service recipient\nlocated in non-taxable territory.\n4 Evaluation of biological activity of This is in vitro research (i.e. outside the\nnovel chemical/ biological entities animal). An assay is first developed and then\nin in-vitro assays the novel chemical is supplied by the service\nrecipient located in non-taxable territory and\nis evaluated in the assay under optimized\nconditions.\n5 Drug metabolism and This process involves investigation whether\npharmacokinetics of new chemical a new compound synthesized by supplier\nentities can be developed as new drug to treat\nhuman diseases in respect of solubility,\nstability in body fluids, stability in liver\ntissue and its toxic effect on body tissues.\nPromising compounds are further evaluated\nin animal experiments using rat and mice.\n6 Safety Assessment/ Toxicology Safety assessment involves evaluation of\nnew chemical entities in laboratory research\nanimal models to support filing of\ninvestigational new drug and new drug\napplication. Toxicology team analyses the\npotential toxicity of a drug to enable fast and\neffective drug development.\n7 Stability Studies Stability studies are conducted to support\nformulation, development, safety and\nefficacy of a new drug.
