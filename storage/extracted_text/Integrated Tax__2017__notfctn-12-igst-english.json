Let us assume that the ratio of populations is 4:1 and when\nthis is applied to the viewership figure of one lakh for this region, the viewership figure for\nBihar and Jharkhand works out to eighty thousand and twenty thousand respectively;\nV. the viewership figure for each State works out to Delhi (one lakh ), Uttar\nPradesh ( one lakh eighty thousand ), Uttarakhand ( twenty thousand ), Bihar ( eighty\nthousand ) and Jharkhand ( twenty thousand ). The ratio is thus 10:18:2:8:2 or 5:9:1-4:]\n( simplification).\nVI .this ratio has to be applied when indicating the breakup of the amount\npertaining to each State.

WX runs this\ncampaign over certain websites. In order to ascertain the statewise breakup of the value of\nthis service which is to be reflected in the invoice issued by WX to ABC, WX has to first\nrefer to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India figures for quarter ending March, 2017,\nas indicated on their website www.trai.gov.in. These figures show the service area wise\ninternet subscribers . There are twenty two service areas. Some relate to individual States\nsome to two or more States and some to part of one State and another complete State. Some\nof these areas are metropolitan areas. In order to calculate the State wise breakup, first the\nState wise breakup of the number of internet subscribers is arrived at. (In case figures of\ninternet subscribers of one or more States are clubbed, the subscribers in each State is to\nbe arrived at by applying the ratio of the respective populations of these States as per the\nlatest census.). Once the actual number of subscribers for each State has been determined,\nthe second step for WX involves calculating the State wise ratio of internet subscribers.\nLet us assume that this works out to 8: 1 : 2... and so on. for Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal\nPradesh, Assam..... and so on. The third step for WX will be to apply these ratios to the\ntotal amount payable to WX so as to arrive at the value attributable to each State.
